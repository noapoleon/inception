# 42 Docker project
Configure 3 docker containers in a network and make them communicate:
- [x] Nginx
- [x] Wordpress + php-fpm
- [x] MariaDB

Bonuses:
- [x] Redis
- [x] FTP Server
- [x] Static Website (Resume)
- [x] Adminer
- [ ] Custom Service (Don't know yet)

Issues:
- [ ] 10 seconds close time for ftp
- [ ] check if uptime-kuma monitor works when nginx killed

> [!CAUTION]
> Remove dummy resume and put good one instead before submitting
